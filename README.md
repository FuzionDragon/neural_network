# Neural Network

A convolutional neural network based off of Alexnet geared towards training and testing on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

This is my neural network project as part of my university course.

### Setup

The training and testing programs require Pytorch and Numpy installed.

If you have Conda installed, you can setup a virtual environment with the required dependencies by running:

```
$ conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt
```
